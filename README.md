Scrapping a web Page using BeautifulSoup and Urllib2 python libraries 

Web scraping is a computer software technique of extracting information from websites. This technique mostly focuses on the transformation of unstructured data (HTML format) on the web into structured data (database or spreadsheet).

non-programming way to extract information out of web pages, you can also look at import.io . It provides a GUI driven interface to perform all basic web scraping operations. 

Libraries required for web scraping:

Urllib2: It is a Python module which can be used for fetching URLs.

BeautifulSoup: It is an incredible tool for pulling out information from a webpage.

BeautifulSoup does not fetch the web page for us. Thatâ€™s why, I use urllib2 in combination with the BeautifulSoup library.
